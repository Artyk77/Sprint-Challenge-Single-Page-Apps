Explain benefit(s) using client-side routing?

Answer:  The route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded on the page, 
allowing us more control and space for data mining. 
When a user clicks on a link, the URL changes but the request to the server is prevented.
The adjustment to the URL will result in a changed state of the application. 
The changed state will ultimately result in a different view of the webpage. 
There are just some elements inside the application that will change.
Because less data is processed, routing between views is generally faster.
Smooth transitions and animations between views are easier to implement.
